I just watched the first episode of the Netflix adaptation of Nickelodeon's Avatar: The Last Airbender - and it's a great redemption after that tragedy that was the movie adaptation.

As I saw Appa for the first time, something touched my heart. I was in college when I first saw The Last Airbender and while it was just an animated series for some, it found a special place in me. The philosophy, the universe, the animation's accuracy to body movements are just amazing. So when I saw the trailer of Netflix's adaptation - a smile grew in my stupid face. I knew someone is going to redeem the series after M. Night Shyamalan's mess.

I find the character of Uncle Iroh as the most endearing - as his inner peace has always been stable throughout the series, hopefully something I could emulate as I continue to grow.

I hope Netflix gives Iroh justice throughout the series, as he is more than just a comic relief of a man who just wants his jasmine tea while playing *pai sho*.

I am excited to watch the remaining episodes this season this weekend!
