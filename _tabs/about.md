# Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Derek Carlos, a technical consultant and a cycling enthusiast. I write scripts to make my life easier and loves to ride bikes. I also post some of my life experiences here added with some thoughts to make me look like I'm a philosopher.

I hope you find the contents of this page useful (either by helping you make your life easier through my scripts, or by just finding something to read while you wait for your anger to subside due to that one lousy email from someone who doesn't know how to follow instructions). I am happy that you're here regardless.

If you find something useful in this corner of the Internet, you can connect with me or [buy me a coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/derekcarlos).
